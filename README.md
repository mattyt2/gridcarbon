# gridcarbon

PLEASE DONT OVERUSE THESE SCRIPTS AS THEY USE MY API KEY!!

This project is basically so I can put in actual LCA values of carbon emissions (ie including embedded emissions) because it√®s winding me up thatwe are calling solar 0 emissions! Sure, 0 operational emissions, but if we include lifecycle hopefully it will drive improvement in supply chain?!? Maybe....
